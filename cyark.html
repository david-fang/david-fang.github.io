                <p>
                    During the summer of 2017, I found myself working as a software
                    engineering intern at CyArk, a non-profit organization dedicated
                    to creating a online, 3D library of the world’s cultural heritage sites. 
                    To do so, they use various technologies such as 3D scanners to
                    create point clouds and photogrammetry tools to collect data on
                    depth and color to create a 3D model for the site.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section-wrapper">
                <div class="title">The problem to solve</div>
                <p>
                    To be able to create incredibly accurate and defined 3D models,
                    each project requires a large amount of pictures. To automate
                    this process, CyArk’s photogrammetry team uses a GigaPan EPIC
                    Pro camera mount that will take a series of panoramic pictures
                    given some configuration on the camera and a set of bounds
                    to capture within. Although the GigaPan significantly improved the
                    workflow, it lacked certain features that could further optimize the
                    needs of the photogrammetry team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To start, the photogrammetry team rotates between a small set
                    of cameras and lens. And for each switch, they must reconfigure
                    the GigaPan so that it knows the field of view of the device it’s
                    carrying. During this reconfiguration process, the team must
                    navigate through a nested series of menus using a keypad and
                    a small LCD screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, in the event that a projectile flies by the camera and
                    obscures the image, the team must manually pan and tilt the
                    GigaPan back to that location to retake the shot. This can be an
                    incredibly slow process; in order to provide precision and torque,
                    the GigaPan sacrifices speed.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section-wrapper">
                <div class="title">The solution</div>
                <p>
                    In order to meet the needs of the photogrammetry team, it was
                    obvious that we needed to add extra features to the GigaPan. The
                    question, then, was how?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why don’t you just change the embedded software?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now let me be honest. At this point in time, I knew nothing about
                    embedded systems or how to write programs for them. This
                    bias played a large part in steering me away from that direction.
                    It did, however, steer me towards a mobile solution. What if I made
                    an app that could interact with the GigaPan via an additional layer
                    of abstraction? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To address the first problem, a mobile app would lessen the amount
                    of effort needed to navigate through nested menus with a keypad,
                    going through one option at a time. The user could easily
                    scroll through a list instead. Secondly, it would be easy to set up a
                    small database within the app to store common camera
                    configurations. The solution would minimally touch the existing
                    device while providing a more direct way to interact with the mount.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Conveniently enough for me, the photogrammetry team uses iPads
                    in the field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal, then, was to hack the GigaPan and make hardware
                    changes to it such that a mobile device could connect to the mount
                    via Bluetooth. Then, all that was left was to create a mobile app that
                    could interact with the mount while providing the necessary
                    features.
